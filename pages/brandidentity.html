          <p>Your website can be your best or worst sales person.
            It can be engaging, informative, enticing and easy-to-use, or it can be boring, confusing, underwhelming and
            hard to use.

            The same as an employee would,

            But how does it work?
          </h1>
          <p>
            First of all we will get to know you and your business a lot better, learning what it is you offer, who your
            target audience is and what you need from a website inorder to meet your desired call to action.
          </p>
          <p>
            You will work closely with your dedicated account manager who will be able to assess your current digital
            marketing strategy and see if it needs tweeking or needs a complete rebuild.
          </p>
          <p><strong>It may be more cost and time effective to start from scratch.</strong></p>
          <p>We will then go away and work on your new website design. If you are happy with what our team has produced
            then we move forward with the development of your site. Our website developers use the latest technology to
            ensure you end up with a clean, responsive site that fits its purpose. </p>

          </h1>

          <p>
            Make sure to take advantage of our <a href="/pages/copywrite.html">copywriting service</a>. Optimise the
            wording of your call to actions to ensure you are getting the most out of your investment. A copywriter can
            be your best salesperson if used effectively.
          </p>
          <p>

            After checking your website speed, we take care of publishing your site onto a trusted UK based server,
            ensuing you premium speeds and minimum downtime.

          </p>
          <p>We design our websites mobile first. The reason being that over half of all ecommerce in the UK is expected
            to come from mobile by 2021. The importance of mobile websites is more than just online transactions. It is
            common practice for consumers to inspect a business, product or service using their mobile before or while
            using a physical retailer. It is now not good enough to be mobile responsive, your website now needs to be
            just as slick and vibrant on mobile and tablet devices as they are on desktop. </p>
          <p><strong>We design all our websites mobile first, by doing so you can be assured that your website looks
              amazing on all your customers devices.
